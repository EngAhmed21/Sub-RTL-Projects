# MUX

A MUX (Multiplexer) is a data selector that selects between several input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line. The selection is directed by a separate set of digital inputs known as select lines. 

This design is for a generic 4x1 MUX with the following specs:
Parameter BITS >> specifies the width of the inputs (default = 4)
4 inputs 
1 output
2-bit selector
Use structural modelling 

Hint: Build your design from some 2x1 MUXs
