## Sychronous Counter

The counters which use clock signal to change their transition are called “Synchronous counters”. This means the synchronous counters depends on their clock input to change state values. In synchronous counters, all flip flops are connected to the same clock signal and all flip flops will trigger at the same time.

Design Specs: Design a generic synch counter as the following implementation
