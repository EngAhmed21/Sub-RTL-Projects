## PWM

Pulse width modulation or PWM is a commonly used control technique that generates analog signals from digital devices such as microcontrollers.
The signal thus produced will have a train of pulses, and these pulses will be in the form of square waves.
Thus, at any given time, the wave will either be high or low. 
Pulse width modulation reduces the average power delivered by an electrical signal by converting the signal into discrete parts. 
In the PWM technique, the signalâ€™s energy is distributed through a series of pulses rather than a continuously varying (analogue) signal.
