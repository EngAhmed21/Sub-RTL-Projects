## LFSR

Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) is a n-bit counter exhibiting pseudo-random behavior. 
It is built from simple shift-registers with a small number of xor gates.  

It is used for:                                                                                                                             
- random number generation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
- counters                                                                                                 
- error checking and correction
                                                                                                  
Its advantages:                                                                                                 
- very little hardware                                                                                                 
- high speed operation                                                                                                 

Design Specs: Design a 4-bit LFSR as the following implementation
