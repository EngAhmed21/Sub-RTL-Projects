#DEMUX

A demultiplexer is a digital circuit that takes a single input signal and chooses one of several output lines based on a set of control signals (also known as a demux or data selector). It essentially serves the opposite purpose from a multiplexer, which selects one output from a multiple of inputs.

This design is for generic 1x4 demux with the following specs:
Parameter BITS >> specifies the width of the inputs
1 input
4 outputs
2-bit selector
