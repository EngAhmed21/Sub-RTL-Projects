## Cache_MM

Cache is the memory inside the CPU & the main source for data to be processed by ALU. Main memory is outside the CPU, but it is connected to it for ex. At case of start the PC on CPU get 
the instructions from RAM by the cache so that it can start running the PC and Desktop Applications, Cache also can write data in main memory.

This is the design for a cache, a main meory, and a controller which controls the data transfer between the two memories. The data is transfered using the direct memory mapping method.
