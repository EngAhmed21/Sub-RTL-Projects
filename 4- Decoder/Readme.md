## Decoder

A binary decoder is a digital circuit that converts a binary code into a set of outputs.
The binary code represents the position of the desired output and is used to select the specific output that is active.
Binary decoders are the inverse of encoders and are commonly used in digital systems to convert a serial code into a parallel set of outputs.
