## ALU

ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is a digital circuit that provides arithmetic and logic operations. It is the fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer.

Parameter (WIDTH) >> specifies the width of the inputs (A, B), the outputs (out)                                                                                                                                                                          
3 inputs >> A, B, 2-bit opcode                                                                                                                                                                          
opcode is the input which chooses the operation to be performed                                                                                                                                                                          
1 output >> out
