# Sub-RTL-Projects

This repo contains some RTL designs or sub-tasks using Verilog which are ranked from easiest to most difficult. Each design covers a topic/concept in using Verilog in RTL design. 

This repo is a practice of using Verilog in RTL design or a refresh of concepts you have in mind. It is also good to know about these various designs and understand how they work as they are frequently used in most of the projects and large designs.

You will find all the specs attached with each design.

I used the QuestaSim simulation environment to simulate the operation of the designed device and VIVADO for evaluating the RTL and the Synthesis design.

The projects:
1- MUX
2- DEMUX
3- Parity Encoder
4- Decoder
5- Adder/Subtractor
6- ALU
7- D FF
8- Simple Shift Register using Structural Modelling
9- Simple Shift Register using Behavioral Modelling 
10- Universal Shift Register
11- Asynchronous Ripple Counter
12- Synchronous Counter
13- UDL Counter
14- BCD Multi-decade Counter
15- Timer
16- PWM
17- LFSR
18- ALSU
19- DSP
20- 1001 & 010 sequence detector
21- Detector of odd number of ones received
22- Swap 2 memory locations
22- Register File
23- Single-Port Synch RAM
24- FIFO
25- Direct Memory Mapping between Cache and main memory.

The topics/concepts covered:
1- Continuous assignment 
2- Structural modelling 
3- Using Parameters to write generic code
