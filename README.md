# Sub-RTL-Projects

This repo contains some RTL designs or sub-tasks using Verilog which are ranked from easiest to most difficult. Each design covers a topic/concept in using Verilog in RTL design. 

This repo is a practice of using Verilog in RTL design or a refresh of concepts you have in mind. It is also good to know about these various designs and understand how they work as they are frequently used in most of the projects and large designs.

You will find all the specs attached with each design. You will also find a testbench for each module to test the functionality of the design.

I used the QuestaSim simulation environment to simulate the operation of the designed device and VIVADO for evaluating the RTL and the Synthesis design.

The topics/concepts covered:        
• Continuous assignment              
• Structural modelling              
• Using Parameters to write generic code                         
• Generate block                    
• Procedural blocks                 
• Behavioural modelling             
• Conditional Statements            
•Operators                          
• For loop                          
• Non blocking assignment           
• Pipelining                         
• FSM                                
• Memories                                
• Testbench
